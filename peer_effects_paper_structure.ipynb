        "I acknowledge that the hierachical clustering (HC) algorithm (defined as 4.1) is developed from Hagedorn, Manovskii and Xin (2021) (henceforce, the ML paper). I propose a plan to clarify the methodology contribution as follows:\n",

        "  * Points taken from the ML paper:\n",
        "    * The vision: similar workers get similar wages in similar firms.\n",
        "    * The idea of using hierarchical clustering (HC) to cluster workers in a hierarchical order based on their similarity. \n",
        "    * The insight of integrating a fast recommender system algorithm with HC to achieve better computational performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Modifications/innovations made in the dissertation to apply HC to the framework with coworker effects:\n",
        "    * The dissertation uses a different similarity metrics (the \"average point-in-time wage differences\", also in **Section 3.1**), while the ML paper uses \"M-similarity\" (i.e. two workers are similiar if only if observed meeting in two different firms, getting similar within-firm wages, and at two different levels between the two firms.)\n",
        "    * The disseration uses a different design of HC. The goal is to cluster workers only, while the goal for the ML paper is to bi-cluster both workers and firms. \n",
        "    * The disseration uses a different identification assumption to incorpate coworker effects, requiring wages to be monotonously increasing in worker productivity. It establishes a different set of theoretic results for identification.\n",
        "    \n",
        "  \n",

        "\n",
        "3. I developed a new machine learning method to cluster workers using GCN method with Amazon DGL library from sratch. The method independently solves worker clustering (defined in **Section 4.1**). I plan to document GCN algorithm in **Section 4.3** in details.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. I integrate GCN with HC to achieve better computational performance following the ML paper. I plan to document the integrated algorithm (GCN+HC) in **Section 4.4** in details.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. I plan to use the following evaluation metrics the to access the performance of the proposed methods (GCN and GCN+HC) over the previous one (HC), and document the simulation results in **Section 5.3**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Metric 1**: The figure of the confusion matrix of the clustering (i.e. the $x_i$-$\\hat{x}_i$ figure; the closer to 45-degree the better.)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Metric 2**: The figure of the estimated spillover function implied by the worker clustering v.s. the ground truth. I report the standard error (RMSE) of the estimated spillover (as % of standard deviation of total log wages).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Metric 3**: RMSE of out-of-sample wage prediction for job switchers on the test set (as % of standard deviation of total log wages).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Metric 4**: Algorithm Runtime (seconds).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**The true contribution seems to be in the second step, i.e. measuring co-worker effects. To help frame the paper and make its contribution clear, it would seem important to provide a clear economic rationalization of what is wrong with the existing methods and how exactly the new method overcomes those limitations.**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The disseration developes methods that allows to measure heterogenous and asymmetric coworker spillover. I will propose the method in **Section 3.2**.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. I show existing methods relying on additive worker and firm fixed effects are subject to a misspecification bias with the presence of wage complementarity. I will present the economic rationalization in **Appendix A3.1**, illustrate the bias with a simple 2x2 toy example in **Appendix A3.2**, assess the size of the bias with calibrated simulation **Appendix A3.3**.\n",
